# gary_bot

a discord bot built for the penspinning community that spews out gary's opinions (very biased)

The PS community suffers from the lack of good information due to resources like UPSB being taken down and many tips/tricks becoming outdated over time.
Thus, gary bot allows users (mostly gary) to quickly answer commonly asked questions without having to retype so much, allowing for quick, efficient communication.
