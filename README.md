# Gary Bot

This is a very simple discord bot meant for the penspinning discord community (originally, the Penstock server).

Any information from this bot is what Gary(me) would say and is very biased. 

# Why?
The PS community suffers from the lack of good information due to resources like the UPSB forums being taken down and many tips/tricks resources becoming outdated.

During the pandemic, there was a huge flux of beginners joining discord and asking the same questions, so I made Gary Bot for an easy way to quickly respond to people. Like if somebody was asking what the best pen to spin is, then somebody could just do >bestpenmod.

TLDR: Gary bot allows users (mostly gary) to quickly answer commonly asked questions without having to retype the same frequently asked questions every time, allowing for quick, efficient communication.

So, Gary Bot is a very simple FAQ page with no real other functionality.
